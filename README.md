This is a simple client-server chat application built using Java. The application allows real-time messaging between a client and a server over a network. 
The user interfaces are built using Java Swing, and communication is handled using sockets.
Features:
Client-Server Architecture: A client connects to the server over a socket and exchanges messages.
Multi-threaded: Separate threads handle reading and writing of messages for both client and server to enable real-time communication.
GUI: A simple graphical user interface built with Swing, which allows users to send and receive messages.
Exit Handling: Either side (client or server) can terminate the chat by typing exit.
